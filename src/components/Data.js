      "Suspected herdsmen have killed 14 people in a fresh attack on the Mchia community in Logo Local Government Area of Benue State.",
    body: "Mchia is a settlement between Abeda and Anyiin, located on Ugba-Anyiin road, Logo local government area in the north-central state. The Special Adviser to the Governor on Security Matters, Colonel Paul Hamba(retired) confirmed this to journalists after a Security Council meeting in Makurdi, the state capital. He said the attack occurred on Wednesday night while the herdsmen, fully armed, stormed the community around 9 pm. Meanwhile, troops of Operation Whirl Stroke have thwarted an attack on the Ortese Internally Displaced Persons (IDP) camp in the Guma Local Government Area of the state. Commander of Operation Whirl Stroke, Major General Kevin Aligbe, disclosed this to Channels Television in an interview, saying the troops killed the herdsmen in the counter- offensive operation. According to the Commander, a soldier who was involved in the operation slumped and died at the hospital. 'We got information about these people(terrorists) planning to attack Ortese, Nkohol and two other locations in Guma LGA on Tuesday night; and we quickly deployed that night and reinforced the places yesterday morning,' he said. 'My troops noticed where those guys were hibernating in the bush and went after them.Of course, they made contact with them.They saw them carrying their casualties and running into the bush.Coming back, one of our soldiers just slumped, he was not shot'. 'He was rushed to the hospital where he was confirmed dead.We are still maintaining the trend in that axis and that is why you have not heard about any attack.We were still in Human when we heard about the Logo attack.'The pattern of settlement of the people too is not helping us.But our troops are managing the situation in Logo.Some things had been happening around that area before now which made us conduct a weeklong operation there about two weeks ago.Even my Sector Commander had to move to the area.'If you notice, these terrorists have killed between the to four people every three to four days.So, we needed to just clear that side.Before you know it, you will just hear that they have attacked and run away.The pattern of settlement is not also helping matters too.They go to isolated areas where they know that security is not near and they kill innocent farmers and other innocent people.'",

      "Governor Udom Emmanuel of Akwa Ibom State says there is a need to review the Exclusive Legislative List to give states more control over critical areas.",
    body: "“I think we need to look back into what we call Exclusive List. There is so much concentration on the centre and renders the states not being able to operate very well. I’m serious about this and if we can be sincere, and leave politics aside, there is so much we can allow states to do so that those who are willing can go ahead and do them,” Emmanuel said on Channels Television’s Sunrise Daily programme on Thursday. The governor spoke in Uyo, the state capital, amid celebrations to mark the 35th anniversary of the creation of the state. At the moment, the Federal Government has control over 68 items in the Exclusive List such as aviation, currency, security, and customs, amongst others, whilst the Concurrent Legislative List provides for items both the government at the centre and state governments share control over.They include allocation of revenue; a collection of taxes; industrial, commercial, or agricultural development; amongst others. The governor said the constitution must be looked at for states to work, like other federating units overseas. “I like reading about the economies of states and countries that are successful.During COVID, I was reading somewhere about New York and they were feeling so bad that the revenue they were getting during COVID dropped to over $16bn.I said my God, this is just a state.So, what makes them make that kind of revenue ? “I know we have a completely different economy but what principle gave rise to that(revenue) ?” he asked. “I still believe, in an economic eye, we need to look at certain things that are in our constitution which we can as well decentralise to make states work.I’ve talked about the Exclusive List. “Something like this is a national issue and you don’t go to the minutest details because the understanding of everybody might not be the same. I try not to say all. A lot of these I keep promising Nigerians that PDP (Peoples Democratic Party) will look into it when we come in,” Emmanuel further stated. “If we look at that, it will help states a whole lot to develop.Take, for example, power.Today, I cannot do anything on this shoreline, I must go back to NPA.There are no decisions I can take.For me to even bring a new aircraft, a whole lot of bottlenecks.I don’t even want to go into that.We are making it so difficult to do business.The Ease of Doing Business is not easy.",

      "The Chief Judge of the Federal High Court Abuja, Justice John Tsoho,  has set aside a consent judgement in favour of Panic Alert Security Systems Limited against the Nigeria Governors’ Forum (NGF).",
    body: "Delivering the ruling on Wednesday, Justice Tsoho, held that the said consent judgement was entered without jurisdiction in its entirety.The company is one of the beneficiaries of the payment of $418 million to consultants and is said to be for payment for professional services in the Paris Club refund to State Governments.It had relied on the consent judgement to lay claim to professional fees of over $40 million.Earlier, the court had restricted the Federal Government from deducting $418 million from the bank accounts of the 36 states. The state governors had accused the Attorney- general of the Federation(AGF), Abubakar Malami, of alleged involvement in the controversial payment. The Governors’ Forum later instructed its counsel, Senior Advocate of Nigeria, Paul Ogbole, to challenge the consent judgment the AGF relied upon in court. Justice Tsoho agreed with counsel to the NGF that the reliefs claimed by the company were premised on a simple contract which by section 251 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999(as amended) strips the court ab initio the required jurisdiction to entertain such matters. Accordingly, the court set aside the consent judgement. By the ruling, all approvals by the AGF, the president, the minister of finance, the Accountant - General of the Federation and the Debt Management Office(DMO) arising from, related to, or concerning Panic Alert’s claims have been voided.",

We must stand together if we truly want to return to power.'\n\nSeveral speakers at the meeting called for the reintegration of aggrieved members and emphasized the importance of zoning, youth inclusion, and strategic alliances. A special reconciliation committee was inaugurated to reach out to estranged figures within the party, including former governors and national assembly members.\n\nMeanwhile, former Vice President and 2023 presidential candidate Atiku Abubakar, who joined virtually, urged the PDP to learn from its past mistakes and focus on grassroots mobilization. 'We cannot afford to repeat 2023,' he warned.\n\nThe party resolved to hold a policy summit next month to unveil its roadmap for governance and social reform.

According to him, it took the intervention of some good samaritans in the area that Mr Abubakar was saved from being lynched by the angry youth in the village. “We have received a report of an attack on a journalist in the Hadejia area where they are currently ravaged by a devastating flood.A mob attacked him, destroyed his mobile phones, and tried to drown him in the water,” DSP Shiisu said. DSP Shiisu however, advised journalists against reaching out to traditional rulers of communities before they start working especially in the Hadejia area as they have a history of attacking journalists during times like this. The police spokesman stated that after reaching the flood - affected area, the journalist presented his identification card and began an interview with some of the victims, but unfortunately, some people began hitting him from behind. “As I stood up to ask why they were beating me, they forced my head down in the water and tried to drown me and continue to hit me when someone brought out a knife then some people now stopped them. “They now took me to the district head house where he gave me new clothes to wear and ask a bike man to take me to Hadejia General hospital for treatment,” the spokesman added. The people of the town are said to be angry with the government for inaction as perennial floods continue to wreak havoc year in and year out in their communities. In 2019, the Special Advisor to the governor on Community, and Social Inclusion, an indigene of Hadejia, Hamza Muhammad, narrowly escaped lynching in the same Ganuwar Kuka village of Hadejia local government.",

    body: "The US Treasury said the morality police were “responsible” for Amini’s death, which has sparked an outpouring of popular anger, as it announced the sanctions “for abuse and violence against Iranian women and the violation of the rights of peaceful Iranian protestors.” The sanctions move was taken as violent protests erupted across Iran following the death last week of Iranian- Kurdish Amini, who had been arrested by the public morality unit of the national police. “Mahsa Amini was a courageous woman whose death in morality police custody was yet another act of brutality by the Iranian regime’s security forces against its own people,” said Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen. “We condemn this unconscionable act in the strongest terms and call on the Iranian government to end its violence against women and its ongoing violent crackdown on free expression and assembly,” Yellen said in a statement.According to an official count, at least 17 people have died in unrest following Amini’s death as women burned their headscarves and protesters denounced the government leadership and restrictions on women. The Oslo- based non - government group Iran Human Rights said at least 31 civilians had been killed in six nights of violence. The Treasury also placed sanctions on Mohammad Rostami Cheshmeh Gachi, the head of the morality police, Haj Ahmad Mirzaei, the head of the morality police’s Tehran division, and five other senior security officials involved in the repressions of protestors. It said Rostami had announced earlier this year that women would be punished for refusing to wear a hijab. “The Iranian government needs to end its systemic persecution of women and allow peaceful protest,” said US Secretary of State Antony Blinken. “The United States will continue to voice our support for human rights in Iran and hold those who violate them to account,” he said in a statement. Treasury sanctions aim to freeze any assets those designated might have under US jurisdiction and forbid any American individuals or companies — including international banks with US operations — from doing business with them, effectively limiting their access to global financial networks.",

An aide to Raisi, a hardline cleric, told Amanpour that he was insisting on a headscarf because of “the situation in Iran,” she said. Iran has been swept by nearly a week of protests since the death of 22 - year - old Mahsa Amini, who died after being arrested by morality police that enforce the clerics’ rules on how women dress. A non - governmental group said that at least 31 Iranian civilians have been killed in the crackdown on the protests, in which women have been seen burning headscarves.",

The epicenter of the 6.9-magnitude earthquake was near the Pacific coast, 84 kilometers(52 miles) south of Coalcoman in the western state of Michoacan, the national seismological agency reported. The US Geological Survey(USGS) estimated the magnitude at 6.8. It was the strongest of more than 1, 200 aftershocks from a magnitude 7.7 quake that struck the same area on Monday, the national seismological agency said. That tremor left two people dead in western Mexico, damaged several thousand buildings and sparked panic more than 400 kilometers away in Mexico City. The latest quake again triggered alarms in the capital shortly after 1: 00 am(0600 GMT) and caused buildings to shake and sway. Many people quickly evacuated their homes when the alarms sounded, some still dressed in pajamas and carrying their pet dogs. “We had a 6.9 magnitude aftershock with an epicenter in Coalcoman,” President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said on Twitter. “It was felt in Michoacan(and the other states of) Colima, Jalisco, Guerrero and Mexico City.So far there are no reports of damage,” he added. Mexico City Mayor Claudia Sheinbaum said official helicopters had flown over the city and that there were no initial reports of destruction. “So far there is no damage in the city after the earthquake,” she tweeted. The quake hit at a depth of 12 kilometers, according to the national seismological agency, while the USGS estimated the depth at 24 kilometers, located about 410 kilometers from Mexico City.",

    body: "The financial year to June 30, 2022 also brought a 22 per cent rise in debt and a 19 per cent increase in wages. The 20-time English champions’ net debt increased from £419.5 million in 2021 to £514.9 million. United attributed the rise in debt mainly to the fall of the pound which increased the value of US dollar borrowings. Among other large items were dividends of £33.6 million to shareholders and the £24.7 million compensation package for former manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, sacked in November 2021. The biggest contributor to United’s spiralling costs was the increase in wages to £384.2 million. The return of Cristiano Ronaldo to Old Trafford, allied to summer signings of Raphael Varane and Jadon Sancho had United fans dreaming of a Premier League title challenge a year ago. Instead, they finished sixth, with their lowest points total of the Premier League era. The failure to qualify for the Champions League will hit United’s finances for this season. The club still heavily backed new manager Erik ten Hag in the summer, spending over £200 million on Antony, Casemiro, Lisandro Martinez and Tyrell Malacia. “Our club’s core mission is to win football matches and entertain our fans,” said United CEO Richard Arnold. “Since our last earnings report, we have strengthened our men’s first team squad, completed a successful summer tour, and established a foundation to build from in the early stages of the 2022 / 23 season under our new manager.” After a disastrous start to Ten Hag’s reign with defeats to Brighton and Brentford, United have won their last four Premier League games to climb to fifth in the table, six points behind early season leaders Arsenal but with a game in hand.",

    body: "The 20-time Grand Slam champion will play doubles with the Spaniard, who has won 22 majors, at the O2 arena in London on Friday. Federer, whose most recent competitive match was a loss to Hubert Hurkacz in last year’s Wimbledon quarter- finals, has been struggling with a knee problem and will not play singles in London. The Laver Cup is a team competition that pits Team Europe against Team World. The six - strong European team, captained by Bjorn Borg, also includes 21 - time major winner Novak Djokovic and three - time major winner Andy Murray. Their opponents, Team World, skippered by John McEnroe, include Taylor Fritz, Felix Auger - Aliassime and Diego Schwartzman. Federer, 41, announced last week he intended to retire after the three - day Laver Cup. He said on Wednesday that finishing his career by teaming up with Nadal would be his dream scenario. Federer said he and Nadal, 36, had always maintained respect for each other even as they vied for the biggest trophies in the sport. “For us as well to go through a career that we both have had and to come out on the other side and being able to have a nice relationship I think is maybe a great message as well to not just tennis but sports and maybe even beyond,” he said. Italian Matteo Berrettini, the first alternate for Europe, will take Federer’s place over the weekend.",

Raducanu reached a career- high 10th in the world in July, but is now 77th, having failed to build on her shock success at Flushing Meadows last year. Wickmayer held her own initially, exchanging breaks to 3 - 3, before the Briton picked up the pace to take the first set. Raducanu carried that momentum into the second set and was leading 4 - 1, only for Wickmayer to fight back to 4 - 4. Raducanu eventually pulled through, breaking Wickmayer’s serve on the way to clinching the set and match.",

Willoughby was appointed as commercial director earlier this month, returning to the club he had previously worked at from 2007 to 2010. “Chelsea Football Club confirms that it has terminated commercial director Damian Willoughby’s employment with immediate effect,” said a club spokesman. “Evidence of inappropriate messages sent by Mr Willoughby, prior to his appointment at Chelsea FC earlier this month, has recently been provided to and investigated by the club. “While they were sent prior to his employment at the club, such behaviour runs absolutely counter to the workplace environment and corporate culture being established by the club’s new ownership.”",

    body: "A trial in Texas federal court ended with jurors deciding that “live” features at Facebook and Instagram used technology patented by Voxer, a company co-founded by Tom Katis, legal documents showed. “We believe the evidence at trial demonstrated that Meta did not infringe Voxer’s patents,” a company spokesperson said in response to an AFP inquiry. “We intend to seek further relief, including filing an appeal.” Katis had reenlisted in the army after the September 11, 2001 attacks in the United States and served as a Special Forces communications sergeant in Afghanistan, court filings said. When his combat unit was ambushed in Kunar province, he felt that the systems for coordinating reinforcements, medical evacuations and more “were ill-suited for time-sensitive communications with multiple groups in a highly disruptive environment,” the complaint said. “Mr. Katis and his team began developing communications solutions in 2006 to remedy these shortcomings,” his lawyers said. “The new technologies enabled transmission of voice and video communications with the immediacy of live communication and the reliability and convenience of messaging.” Facebook approached San Francisco-based Voxer about potential collaboration after it launched a Walkie Talkie app in 2011, but no agreement was reached, according to legal documents. Instead, the lawsuit argued, Facebook went on to launch Facebook Live and Instagram Live, incorporating Voxer technology into the features.",

The minister said the enactment of the Petroleum Industry Act(PIA) on August 16, 2022 was a “watershed moment for the nation, the industry and all stakeholders alike, signaling the beginning of a more conducive environment for investment, output, industrial and national growth, while also addressing legitimate grievances of resource host- communities most impacted by resource extraction operations”.Sylva said the “PIA 2021, at full implementation, will create massive investment opportunities, improve transparency, attract investors, and reposition the Nigerian Oil and Gas industry for sustainable growth,” urging investors “to capitalize on the sustainable incentives provided by the PIA 2021 to invest in the oil and gas industry in Nigeria” with no future regret. The minister told the gathering that the “PIA 2021 has established a legal, governance, regulatory, and fiscal framework for the petroleum industry, host community development, and associated matters” adding that “it provides fiscal certainty, improves regulations and incentives for investment, including up to ten- year tax vacations, while guaranteeing better take for both government and private investors, thereby balancing rewards with risk”. The minister who said the PIA has set the foundation for a sustainable growth in the sector with the establishment of the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited(NNPCL), Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority(NMDPRA) and Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission(NUPRC) reassured the international investors of government’s commitment in the sector. “This administration remains committed to ensure a full implementation of these carefully conceived reforms to foster efficiency and attract investments and development of supporting infrastructure along the oil and gas value chain as embedded in our policy aspirations for the sector.",

      "The European Union’s second-highest court on Wednesday overwhelmingly upheld the EU’s record fine against Google over its Android operating system for mobile phones, slightly reducing the fee for technical reasons.",
    body: "In a statement, the EU’s General court said it “largely confirms the commission’s decision that Google imposed unlawful restrictions on manufacturers of Android mobile devices” in order to benefit its search engine. The court, however, said the fine should be slightly reduced to 4.125 billion euros($4.1 billion), instead of the 4.3 billion euros decided by the commission in 2018 after reviewing the duration of the infringement. The levy remains the EU’s biggest ever despite Google’s arguments that the commission’s case was unfounded and falsely relied on accusations it imposed its search engine and Chrome browser on Android phones. The company also pushed the case that the EU was unfairly blind to the strength of Apple, which imposes or gives clear preference to its own services such as Safari on iPhones. Google insisted that downloading rival apps was only a click away and that customers were in no way tied to Google products on Android. The EU and complainants responded that Google used contracts with phone makers in the early days of Android to stifle rivals. “This shows the European Commission got it right,” said Thomas Vinje, a lawyer representing FairSearch, whose original complaint launched the case in 2013. “Google can no longer impose its will on phone makers.Now they may open their devices to competition in search and other services, allowing consumers to benefit from increased choice,” he added. The decision by the General Court is not necessarily the end of the story.Both sides can turn to the EU’s highest court, the European Court of Justice, for a final say on the fine, which was the equivalent of $5 billion when levied.",

      "Convicted Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes on Monday asked for a new trial, saying a star prosecution witness showed up at her home saying he felt he had “done something wrong.”",
    body: "Holmes is scheduled to be sentenced in October after a jury early this year found her guilty of defrauding investors in her blood-testing startup Theranos. Holmes is a rare example of a tech exec being brought to book over a company flaming out, in a sector littered with the carcasses of money- losing businesses that once promised untold riches. Her case shone a spotlight on the blurred line between the hustle that characterizes the industry and outright criminal dishonesty. But attorneys for Holmes said that former Theranos lab manager Adam Rosendorff, who was part of the prosecution’s case, arrived unannounced at her California home in August looking disheveled and saying he needed to speak with her. “He said he feels guilty, it seemed like he was hurting,” Holmes’s partner William Evans said of Rosendorff in an exhibit with the court. “He said when he was called as a witness he tried to answer the questions honestly but that the prosecutors tried to make everybody look bad(in the company).” Evans said he turned Rosendorff away from the home he shares with Holmes and their young son, telling Rosendorff that Holmes could not speak with him. “He said he thought it would be healing for both himself and Elizabeth to talk,” said Evans.” – Different verdict ?  Evans recounted Rosendorff saying that both he and Holmes were just starting out in their careers when they worked together at Theranos, and that “everyone was working so hard to do something good and meaningful.” Holmes had vowed to revolutionize health diagnostics with self - service machines that could run an array of tests on just a few drops of blood, a vision that drew high - profile backers and made her a billionaire on paper by the age of 30. She was hailed as the next tech visionary on magazine covers and collected mountains of investors’ cash, but it all collapsed after Wall Street Journal reporting revealed the machines did not work as promised. Jurors found her guilty of four counts of tricking investors. But the jury also acquitted her on four charges and could not reach a verdict on three others. The 38 - year - old now faces the possibility of decades behind bars.Attorneys for Holmes argued that Rosendorff was a star witness for prosecutors, and that his statements put the guilty verdict in doubt.",

      "Apple has been barred from selling iPhones without a charger in Brazil and fined more than $2 million over the issue, the government said Tuesday, after accusing the US tech giant of “discriminatory practices.”",
    body: "In an official notice, Brazilian authorities ordered “the immediate suspension of the distribution of iPhone brand smartphones, regardless of model or generation, that are not accompanied by a battery charger.” The Ministry of Justice and Public Security ordered the California company to pay a fine of 12.28 million reais(nearly $2.4 million). The measure from the Department of Consumer Protection and Defense effectively prohibits the sale of all iPhone 12 and 13 models. Apple has been under investigation in Brazil since December for “the sale of an incomplete product,” “discrimination against the consumer” and “the transfer of responsibility to third parties” by offering iPhone 12s and newer versions without chargers for power outlets, according to an official statement. The company has faced fines from Brazilian state agencies before, but “did not take any measures to minimize the harm and until now continued to sell the cellular devices without chargers,” the statement said. According to Brazilian authorities, Apple alleges that the decision to exclude chargers from iPhone sales comes from an “environmental commitment.” But the ministry determined “there is no effective demonstration of environmental protection on Brazilian soil as a consequence” of Apple’s policy, and accused the company of “deliberate discriminatory practices against consumers.” “There is no justification for an operation which, in aiming to reduce carbon emissions, leads to the introduction into the consumer market of a product whose use depends on the acquisition of another(product) which is also marketed by the company,” the official notice added.",

      "Twitter said Thursday it has begun actively testing an edit button, after months of publicly discussing such a tweak.",
    body: "“Edit Tweet is a feature that lets people make changes to their Tweet after it’s been published,” the company said on its blog. “Think of it as a short period of time to do things like fix typos, add missed tags, and more.” Under the revision being studied, users could edit a tweet “a few times” in the 30 minutes after the initial posting, in ways that transparently note the changes to “help protect the integrity of the conversation and create a publicly accessible record of what was said,” the company said.Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk, who is locked in a lawsuit with Twitter over a potential acquisition of the micro-blogging platform, had backed an edit button shortly before the company said in April it was studying the change. Users of Twitter Blue — the subscription offering now available in the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zeeland– “receive early access to features and help us test them before they come to Twitter,” the company said. An aim of the tweak is that “Tweeting will feel more approachable and less stressful, Twitter said. “You should be able to participate in the conversation in a way that makes sense to you, and we’ll keep working on ways that make it feel effortless to do just that.” However, a Twitter spokesperson said the test will not necessarily be employed universally on the platform.",
